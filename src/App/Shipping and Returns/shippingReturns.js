            <p> At LaCarnivores shipping is always free of charge, as long as the shipment is within the US we at LaCarnivores 
                can ship through our partner USPS. We provide one shipment method "First Class" with USPS, we do plan on expanding
                internationally with more shipping options in the future. All plants are shipped bare root wrapped in sphagnum-moss
                and packaged carefully to avoid damage and stress. We do provide heat and cold packs for weather conditions that may affect the plants 
                health during transit, these may be bought seperately on the website and applied to the plants on your cart. We will
                advise of weather conditions that may affect your purchase as much as possible through notifications on the site or by email.
            </p>
            <h3>Shipment Tracking</h3>
            <p> As soon as a succesfull purchase is made, all customers will recieve an email shortly after, one containing the reciept of the purchase
                and another regarding the tracking and location of the packages. The system we currently use automates and determines how many
                plants from your order fit into a package, once the system finishes its packing measurements and details its up to our
                employees at LACarnivores to fulfill your order. The system once done will send an email with a tracking number(s) regarding your order.

            <p> Orders may take up to 3 - 14 buisiness days depending on the location and weather conditions of the shipping location. We do reccomend to track your packages 
                consistently with the provided tracking link. If there are any discretions or issues along transit, we at LaCarnivores are not responsible for delivery failures
                and it is the customers to responsibilty to resolve any issues with the courrier service. Plants are living things and do not live inside an enclosed box, so
                any issues and delays with the mailing service are critical and need to be addressed as soon as possible for live plant arrival or proof of insurance.    
            </p>
            <h3>Shipment Damages</h3>
            <p> If plants are dead on arrival that are not caused by shipping damages, LaCarnivores will gladly send another one free of charge. Proof of damages need to be 
                documented and photographed in order to process another order. LaCarnivores does not accept any refunds for live and healthy plants on arrival. Arrival is 
                considered 'arrived' when the package reaches its destination on the tracking system. Once the package(s) has 'arrived', the customer will have 48 hours
                from arrival to claim any issues or damages with their purchase, this includes damaged boxing/products, dead plants, wrong plant/product.
            </p>
            <h3>Returns</h3>
            <p> In the event of a return, LaCarnivores will provide a prepaid shipping label for the plant, and we will ship another of the same plant or that of a similair
                value. In the case that the plant is completely dead and unacceptable, proof of documents and photographs will be enough for a refund. Plants that are to be returned 
                need to be shipped 1 day from recieving the prepaid return label. 
            </p>
            <h3>Cancellation and Updates</h3>
            <p> Cancellation and updates are valid until time of packaging, with the set times mentioned above this gives us and the customers time to adjust for change of
                conditions. This may include refunds, additions to orders such as buying heat/cold packs or add/remove plants. Any addition post payment and before package time
                will incur a seperate payment and email describing the details of the addition in a timely manner. Cancelling before packaging will reimburse a full refund.
